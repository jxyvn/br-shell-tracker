<img src="roulette.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>Buckshot Roulette Shell Tracker is a tool for keeping a consistent count of the shells left in the rounds rotation.</p>
<p>Using this tool allows players to make better judgements with their turn, and hopefully last longer.</p>
<p>While we make your game much easier, this doesn't guarantee your spot as the winner.</p>
<p>Remember, this is more of a tool to calculate your odds of having a red shell in the chamber, rather than your chances at winning.</p>
<h2>Good Luck</h2>
